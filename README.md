# React Recipe app

This is a web application that I've been developing while working through the Udemy tutorial, [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/).
* The purpose of this app is for viewing cooking recipes
* Data for the app is served up by the back-end that I've developed, [recipe API](https://github.com/DrewStock/recipe-API)
* The app is hosted on GitHub pages at https://drewstock.github.io/React-Recipe-app/ 
* Plans for future development
    * Build UI functionality for: 
        * Searching recipes
        * Adding a new recipe
        * Updating existing recipes
        * Deleting recipes
        * Creating user accounts
